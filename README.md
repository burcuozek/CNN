# CNN

CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. It is a type of artificial neural network architecture designed for processing structured grid data, such as images and video. CNNs are particularly effective in computer vision tasks, including image recognition, object detection, and image classification.

Key features of CNNs include:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolutional operations to input data, enabling the network to learn hierarchical features and patterns. Convolution helps capture spatial hierarchies in the input.

Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample the spatial dimensions of the input, reducing the computational complexity of the network. Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.

Activation Functions: Non-linear activation functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), are applied to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn more complex representations.

Fully Connected Layers: These layers connect every neuron from one layer to every neuron in the next layer, enabling the network to make final predictions or classifications.

CNNs have demonstrated significant success in image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. They have been pivotal in advancements in image recognition, object detection, and various other computer vision applications. Additionally, CNN architectures have been adapted and applied to other domains, such as natural language processing (e.g., in text classification tasks) and speech recognition.


Within this repository, I am implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the widely recognized MNIST dataset. MNIST comprises a collection of handwritten digits, ranging from 0 to 9, and serves as a benchmark dataset for tasks such as digit recognition in machine learning
